IAM - Identity and Access Management.
IAM User created has no permission by default. permanent access/long live credentials.

IAM Roles - virtual user. temporary access.


IAM User has limit of 5000 users.

IAM Group - logical grouping of user which makes the user administration easy.


IAM User Access Types: 
	1. Programmatic acces - enables access ID and secret key for development tools.
	2. AWS Management Console access - enables password that allows user access the AWS Management Console.
	
	
** Least privillege access is the IAM best practice.
** Give the minimum permission to the user to do his job.
** When creating a user, forcing a user to change his password on the next login is a best practice.


3 options when assigning permission to the newly created user:
	1. Add user to the groutp.
	2. Copy permission from the existing user.
	3. Attach existing policies directly.

*** Secret access key can only be seen during the user creation.
*** If ther secret access key lost it. You can deactivate and generate a new access key.
