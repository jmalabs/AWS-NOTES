Virtual Private Cloud.

VPC - Virtual environment for user.
	- Virtually dedicated t
	- You cannot talk to other VPC in the cloud unless there's an agreement.
	- It allows only what you are allowing.
	- By default VPC cannot talk to the other VPC.
	
*** VPC is region specific.
	
AWS
 ---> Region
	---> VPC
		---> Availabity Zone
		
*** VPC can extend to multiple AZ using subnets.

*** Subnet CANNOT extend to multiple AZ.


VPC 
 - Is a virtual network or data center inside AWS for one client,
	or a department in an enterprise or just a test environment.

 - The AWS client has full control over resources and virtual servers hosted in AWS
 
 - Is similar to having your own data center inside AWS.
 
 - Logically isolated from other VPC's on AWS.
 
 - You can have one or more IP address subnets in VPC.	
 
 
 *** A VPC is confined to an AWS region and cannot extend between regions. (Region Specific)
 
 
 VPC Components:
 
 1. CIDR and IP address subnets (RFC 1918)
 2. Implied router - used to commuicated by other subnets. Created by default.
 3. Route tables - Destination/Target.
 4. Internet gateway - used to commmunicate outside VPC.
 5. Security Groups - Virtual firwall. Proctect EC2 instances. Last defense in VPC.
 6. Network Access COntrol List (N. ACLs) - first line of defense. Work at subnet level.
 7. Virtual Private Gateway - used to connect to your headquarters.
 
 
 IPv6 - all addresses are Public.
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Implied Router
  - it connects your subnets.
  - central VPC routing function.
  
 Each subnet has its own route table.
 
 Route tables - contains the routing rule records.
 
 - Main Route Table - created by default.
 - Custom Route Table - created by user.
 
 *** You can have up to 200 route tables per VPC.
 *** You can have up to 50 route entries per route table.
 *** Each Subnet MUST be associated with only one route table at any given time.
 *** If you dont specify a subnet-to-route association, the subnet (when created) will be associated with the main (default) VPC route table.
 
 
 *** You can change the subnet association to another route table.
 
 *** You can also edit the main (default) route table if you need. you cannot delete the main route table.
  - You can update the flag to swap MAIN route table.
  
 **** EVERY ROUTE TABLE IN A VPC COMES WITH A DEFAULT RULE THAT ALLOWS ALL VPC SUBNETS TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER.
  - YOU CANNOT MODIFY OR DELETE THIS RULE.
 
 **** If there's a question regarding Subnet communication, don't even look at the route table configuration because by defaulet there's a default rule that allow subnets to communicate with one another.
    - Possible issues are the Security and N ACLS.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------
IP ADDRESSING

RFC 1918 (Public routable)

**** Once the VPC is created, you cannot change its CIDR block.
/28 - minimum size of the CIDR block. 4^2
/32 - maximum size of the CIDR block. 16^2

**** If you need a different size you have to create new VPC.
**** The different subnets within a VPC cannot overlap(basic TCP/IP rule).

*** YOU CANNOT RESIZE THE CIDR YOU HAVE CREATE, HOWEVER YOU CAN EXPAND IT. BY CREATING SECONDARY CIDR.
 
 
**** RESERVER IPs******

First 4 and Last IP are reserved.
1. Ex. If the subnet is 10.0.0.0/24
Meaning you have /24 for the network and /8 for the host.
	- 10.0.0.0 is the base network
	- 10.0.0.1 VPC router
	- 10.0.0.2 DNS related.
	- 10.0.0.3 Reserved for future use.
	- 10.0.0.255 last IP.
	
2. Ex. If the subnet is 10.0.0.0/25
Meaning you have /25 for the network and /7 for the host.
	- 10.0.0.0 is the base network
	- 10.0.0.1 VPC router
	- 10.0.0.2 DNS related.
	- 10.0.0.3 Reserved for future use.
	- 10.0.0.127 last IP.
	
	
------------------------------------------
Internet Gateway
- IG is created by default when VPC is created.
- is the gateway through which your VPCcommunicates with the internet, and with other  AWS services.

- Is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available component.
	* If there's a question regarding perfomance or slowness dont even look at the Internet Gateway because IG is completely provisioned by AWS.
- One IG per VPC.

- performs NAT between your private and public IPV4 addresses.

--------------------------------------------
Public Vs Private Subnet.

RFC 1918 
 - Private IP addresses
 1. 10.0.0.0
 2. 172.16.0.0
 3. 192.168.0.0

VPC Types

1. Default VPC
	- Created in each AWS region when AWS account is created.
	- Has default CIDR ,security group, N ACL, and route tables settings.
	- Has internet gateway by default.
2. Custom VPC
	-Is a VPC creatd by the account owner.
	- AWS user creating VPC can decide the CIDR block.
	- Same with default VPC, Custom VPC has default security group, N ACL and route tables.
	- Does not have a IG by default. You have to create IG if you want your VPC communicates with Web.
	
	
------------------------------------------------------------
Security Groups
 - Virtual Firewall
 - Line of defense
 - Functions at the ENI level.
 
 
 - is a virtual firewall.
 - it controls traffic at the virtual server (EC2 instance) level
	- Specifically at the ENI or virtual Network Interface level.
 - Up to 5 security groups per EC2 instance can be applied.
 - Stateful - return traffic of allowed inbound traffic is allowed even if there is no rule allowing it.
 - Can only permits rules, cannot have deny rules.
 - Implicit deny rule at the end.
 - Security groups are associated with Ec2 instances network interface.
 - All rules are evaluated to find permit rule. If no rule that permits it will hit the implicit deny rule.
